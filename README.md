This repository contains the code and notes from my learning journey through the book ["Zero to Production in Rust: an opinionated introduction to backend development" by Luca Palmieri.](https://www.zero2prod.com/)

I hope that by sharing my code and notes, it may be helpful to others who are also learning Rust and backend development.


This book is easily ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️'s by the way, Luca and contributers if you see this, thank you for your work!


### What I do differently

There are a few things I do differently to the book, which I will list here:

- I use [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) instead of Digital Ocean
    - It's a lot cheaper than DigitalOcean
    - It's a lot easier to set up than DigitalOcean (in my opinion)
    - It's a lot easier to deploy to than DigitalOcean (in my opinion)
