This repository contains the code and notes from my learning journey through the book ["Zero to Production in Rust: an opinionated introduction to backend development" by Luca Palmieri.](https://www.zero2prod.com/)

I hope that by sharing my code and notes, it may be helpful to others who are also learning Rust and backend development.


This book is easily ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️'s by the way, Luca and contributers if you see this, thank you for your work!
